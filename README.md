localizethat
============

LocalizeThat! is a localization tool for Mozilla software written in Java SE with JPA and Derby Embedded. It will eventually replace MozillaTranslator (see https://kenai.com/projects/moztrans).

Both glossarymanager and localizethat projects are part of my long-standing final year project, so despite being open source, unfortunately I can't accept contributions until I get the degree.
